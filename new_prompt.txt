Starting from the following text "The global information society, coupled with modern innovative capabilities, contributes to the digital transformation of countries, industries, and individual companies. Due to digitization, economic growth is achieved, and the competitiveness of goods and services increases. Given the significant scale and pace of digital transformations that take place today, the speed of responding to their main trends is a significant competitive advantage. In common practice, one of the most successful tools of information and communication technologies determines digitalization [1]. The development of the information society, the smart economy, and globalization processes make it necessary to digitize the marketing activity because consumers prefer those brands and companies that quickly master the use of digital channels. However, [2] emphasize that the uniform approach to this process must be refused because of the specifics of national socio-cultural profiles of consumers. At the same time, the number of business processes is increasing under current conditions, which requires new methods and approaches to the transformation of views on managing the marketing activity of an enterprise. The experiences of many foreign and domestic companies indicate the significant impact of digitalization on sales activities as an essential element of the enterprise’s marketing system. Digital methods of processing and using information are a major source of efficiency and effectiveness of such activities [3]. Modern globalization challenges contribute to the rapid implementation of the latest innovative capabilities of the digital world and the activity of railway transport as the leading industry in the road transport industry of the country. JSC “Ukrzaliznytsia” [4] which was one of the first companies that actively digitized its work, was selected to test the proposed methodology. In particular, it refers to the digitalization of the sale of electronic tickets. Competition in the market of transport services requires enterprises to introduce new approaches to the provision of quality online ticket sales services. The JSC “Ukrzaliznytsia,” which is directly involved in the sale of electronic travel documents, is interested not only in their confirmation and sales, but also in promoting them among various modern social platforms and networks, tracking demand for specific areas, determining the need for additional wagons or trains, and identifying problems which online buyers may face. The paper investigates the impact of digitalization on sales activity (as one of the key components of marketing) in the service industry. The main advantages of digitalizing the sale of electronic travel documents are the following: the facilitation of communication between the person and the information system; the ability for passengers to use devices to obtain real-time data on the availability and number of available seats in a particular car and train; the ability to receive information about the number of passengers traveling on a particular train in real-time; the ability to plan and organize the required number of trains on different routes according to customers’ requests; and openness and accessibility of services to consumers, regardless of their location and time of day. Although there are the works of scientists, practitioners, and managers that are devoted to the study of this problem, the impact of digital technologies on marketing activities in general, and in particular, on sales in service sectors, such as the implementation of travel documents of enterprises providing railway transport, has not been sufficiently investigated from a practical point of view. That is why our goal was to present the impact of digitalization on the effectiveness of marketing activities of the enterprise." provide me a multiple choice quiz with 10 questions that respects the following requirements: each question must be unique, for each question must generate 4 possible answers of which only one must be the correct one (specify it after the possible answers)
